Multiple Linear Regression:
    - Used for goal predictions for matches
    - Need at least 10 observations per variables
    - variables will be based on table columns
        - every value in the table column will be used to predict the other values in the table column

Logistical Regression 
    - Used to calculate discrete outcomes like winners and losers for table point predictions
    - Atleast 10 obeservations for each fixure
    - For games with less than 10 observations, use averages to predict the outcome and goals.
